The project involves analyzing the unemployment rate, a key economic indicator that measures the percentage of unemployed individuals in the total labor force. The focus is on examining the sharp increase in unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic and identifying trends, patterns, and contributing factors.

Project Summary:

	1.	Objective:
	•	To analyze and visualize the unemployment rate trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.
	•	To understand the impact of the pandemic on different sectors, demographics, and regions.
	2.	Data Collection:
	•	Gather unemployment rate data from reliable sources like government labor departments, World Bank, or other datasets.
	•	Include additional data, such as sector-wise employment, age groups, gender, and regional statistics, for deeper insights.
	3.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Handle missing or inconsistent data.
	•	Standardize data formats and ensure consistency across datasets.
	4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Visualize trends in unemployment rates over time using line plots.
	•	Analyze the impact of COVID-19 on specific sectors or demographics.
	•	Identify correlations between unemployment rates and other factors, such as GDP or lockdown policies.
	5.	Modeling and Predictions (Optional):
	•	Use time-series analysis models like ARIMA or machine learning models to predict future unemployment trends.
	•	Identify key factors influencing unemployment rates through regression analysis.
	6.	Visualization:
	•	Create interactive dashboards or reports showing trends, heatmaps by region, and sectoral impacts.
	•	Highlight key findings, such as periods of the sharpest increase or recovery.
	7.	Conclusion:
	•	Summarize the findings, including the overall impact of COVID-19 on unemployment.
	•	Provide actionable insights or policy recommendations for mitigating future economic disruptions.
